# TODO Some of your lists are nullable while others aren't. For example, the "appearsIn" and "starships" fields in Human.
# Read this: https://graphql.github.io/learn/schema/#lists-and-non-null
# Be consistent. Also, it's bad practice for lists to contain null elements, and also for the lists themselves to be null, so you should prefer the following:
# starships: [Starship!]!
# Instead of:
# starships: [Starship]
